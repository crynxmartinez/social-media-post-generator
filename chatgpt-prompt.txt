I need you to write content for a LinkedIn carousel post. Each quote will be displayed on its own slide.

RULES:
- Write exactly [NUMBER] quotes
- Each quote should be 1-2 sentences max (under 15 words is ideal)
- Make them punchy, bold, and memorable
- No hashtags, no emojis
- Each quote on its own line
- Topic: [YOUR TOPIC]
- First line should be a catchy TITLE for the carousel

STYLE:
- Direct and confident tone
- Speak to entrepreneurs/professionals
- Actionable or thought-provoking
- Similar to how Alex Hormozi or Leila Hormozi write

OUTPUT FORMAT:

=== CAROUSEL SLIDES ===
[Title on first line, then quotes - one per line, no numbering]

=== LINKEDIN POST ===
[Write a short engaging post (3-5 lines) to accompany the carousel. Include a hook, brief context, and a call-to-action. Add 3-5 relevant hashtags at the end.]

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
